# Hamtapper
Hamster airdrop automation bot written in Python. This script can handle multiple users asynchronously (or each user on seperate Thread), simulating
taps and uses knapsack algorithm [(borrowed from here)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14UNSWGEo8Owjb0F9200-RMqZttONt-Z5?usp=sharing)
to buy best upgrade cards automatically to gain more profit.

## Usage
**This script probably wont work and the airdrop phase is over.** The source code is now open-source for reference.
